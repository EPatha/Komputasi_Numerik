# Numerical Computing

Numerical computing is a field of study that uses computational algorithms to solve mathematical problems numerically. It is widely applied in engineering, physics, economics, and computer science to perform simulations, solve differential equations, and optimize processes where analytical solutions are impractical or impossible.

## Key Topics in Numerical Computing

### 1. **Numerical Methods**
   - **Root Finding**: Methods like Bisection, Newton-Raphson, and Secant method to solve nonlinear equations.
   - **Linear Algebra**: Solving systems of linear equations using Gaussian Elimination, LU Decomposition, and Iterative Methods.
   - **Numerical Integration and Differentiation**: Techniques like Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson's Rule, and finite difference methods.
   - **Optimization**: Algorithms like Gradient Descent and Newton's Method.

### 2. **Differential Equations**
   - Solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) using methods like Euler's Method, Runge-Kutta methods.
   - Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) solved using finite difference or finite element methods.

### 3. **Error Analysis**
   - Understanding truncation errors, round-off errors, and stability of algorithms.

### 4. **Matrix Computations**
   - Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.
   - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
